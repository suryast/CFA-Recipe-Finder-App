1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
1 tablespoon boiling water
2 tablespoons olive oil
200g chorizo sausages, sliced
1 large brown onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, crushed
1.4kg chicken pieces, trimmed
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 1/2 cups Massel chicken style liquid stock
2 cups arborio rice
400g can diced tomatoes
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 cup frozen peas

METHOD
Step 1
Place saffron in a small bowl. Add boiling water and set aside.
Step 2
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a paella pan or a large, deep frying pan over medium-high heat.
Add chorizo and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.
Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel.
Step 3
Add remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, onion and garlic to pan.
Cook for 2 minutes or until soft.
Add chicken.
Cook, turning often, for 5 to 6 minutes or until golden.
Add wine and 1/2 cup stock. Reduce heat to medium.
Simmer, uncovered, turning occasionally, over medium-low heat for 10 minutes or until almost all liquid has evaporated.
Step 4
Add rice, saffron mixture, tomatoes, paprika and 1 1/2 cups stock.
Return to simmer and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally
to prevent mixture from catching on bottom of pan, for 15 minutes or until almost all liquid is absorbed.
Step 5

Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 8 minutes or until stock is just absorbed.
Season with salt and pepper. Serve paella at the table from the pan.
