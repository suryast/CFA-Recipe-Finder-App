INGREDIENTS
4 eggs
20g butter
40g baby spinach
Bread, toasted, buttered, to serve


METHOD
Step 1
Whisk eggs and 1/3 cup cold water together in a bowl until combined.
Season with salt and pepper.
Step 2
Heat a small frying pan over medium-high heat until just warm. Add half the butter.
Tilt pan back and forth until butter sizzles and spreads.
Step 3
Whisk eggs again. Pour half the mixture into pan.
Tilt pan to cover base in mixture.
Using a wooden spoon, drag set egg from outer edge into centre. 
Tilt pan so uncooked egg comes in contact with base.
Step 4
Cook for 1 minute or until top is almost set.
Sprinkle with half the spinach.
Fold over to enclose spinach.
Transfer to a plate.
Repeat with remaining butter, egg mixture and spinach.
Serve with toast.
